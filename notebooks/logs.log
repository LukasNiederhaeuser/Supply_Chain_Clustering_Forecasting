In 0.22.0, predict_quantiles return default column level 0 name will change for univariate probabilistic quantile forecasts from 'Quantiles' to variable name. The old behaviour can be retained by setting the legacy_interface argument to True, until 0.23.0 when the legacy_interface argument will be removed.
